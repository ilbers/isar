# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates will only be provided on top of the `master` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report any potential security vulnerability via a public channel
(mailing list, github issue, etc.). Instead, create a report via
https://github.com/ilbers/isar/security/advisories/new or contact the
maintainers by email at security@isar-build.org. Please provide a detailed
description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, the affected versions and,
if already available, a proposal for a fix. You should receive a response
within 15 business days. If for some reason you do not, please follow up by
email to ensure we received your original message.

If we confirm the issue as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory on
github and give credits for your report if desired. We follow the coordinated
vulnerability disclosure model and will define an appropriate disclosure
timeline together with you.
