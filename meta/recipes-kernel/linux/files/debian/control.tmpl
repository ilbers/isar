Package: linux-image-${KERNEL_NAME_PROVIDED}
Build-Profiles: <kernel>
Architecture: any
Depends: ${KERNEL_DEBIAN_DEPENDS}
Description: ${KERNEL_NAME_PROVIDED} Linux kernel, version @KR@
 This package contains the Linux kernel, modules and corresponding other
 files, version: @KR@.

Package: linux-headers-${KERNEL_NAME_PROVIDED}
Build-Profiles: <kernel>
Architecture: any
Depends: ${KERNEL_HEADERS_DEBIAN_DEPENDS}, ${perl:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: ${KERNEL_NAME_PROVIDED} Linux kernel headers for @KR@
 This package provides kernel header files for @KR@ on ${DISTRO_ARCH}
 .
 This is useful for people who need to build external modules

Package: linux-libc-dev
Build-Profiles: <!nolibcdev kernel>
Section: devel
Provides: linux-kernel-headers
Architecture: ${KERNEL_LIBC_DEV_ARCH}
Description: Linux support headers for userspace development
 This package provides userspaces headers from the Linux kernel. These headers
 are used by the installed headers for GNU glibc and other system libraries.

Package: linux-libc-dev-${DISTRO_ARCH}-cross
Build-Profiles: <!nolibcdev cross !kbuild>
Section: devel
Provides: linux-kernel-headers-${DISTRO_ARCH}-cross
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Description: Linux Kernel Headers for development (for cross-compiling)
 This package provides headers from the Linux kernel.  These headers
 are used by the installed headers for GNU glibc and other system
 libraries. They are NOT meant to be used to build third-party modules for
 your kernel. Use linux-headers-* packages for that.
